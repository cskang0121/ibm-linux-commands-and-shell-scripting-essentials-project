# Project Description

Even nowadays, many companies suffers from a bottleneck - each day, employees must painstakingly perform repetitive and tedious tasks, such as accessing encrypted password files on core servers, and backup those that were updated within the last 24-hours. This introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work. Hence, such periodic processes should be automated.
